# Run time analysis

## Task0
The execution of the program takes 2 lines.Complexity->O(1).

## Task1
The execution of both calls and texts perform n times.Complexity->O(n).

## Task2
The execution takes n time to run.Complexity->O(n).

## Task3
The code is iterated for n times.So O(n) and sorting function in implemented which have a time complexity
of O(n log n).So, O(n)+O(n log n) becomes O(n log n) complexity.
Complexity->O(n log n).


## Task4
The list of texters take two for loops inside the list so the complexity is O(n^2).
Complexity->O(n^2).
